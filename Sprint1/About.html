                            <hr>
                            <p>Our mission is to give people around the world who lack access to books the opportunity to read for pleasure, study and lifelong learning.
                               Certified Books puts this mission and the public good above financial interests, giving over 80% of our profit margin to independent bookstores.
                               It is written in our governance documents that we will never sell the company to Amazon or any major U.S. retailer.
                               As a Climate Neutral company, we are committed to operating sustainably.

                            <h3>OUR VISSION</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                Our vision is a world where everyone has access to books that will enrich, improve and change their lives.
                                Between now and 2025 we will focus on creating the opportunity to read for people who face the greatest barriers to learning – sharing the power of the book and helping to create a more equal world.
                                A book might seem like a small thing in the fight against inequality – but we see every day how a book can spark a transformation. 
                                That knowledge is at the heart of this strategy.
